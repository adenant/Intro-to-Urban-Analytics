## Urban Analytics
- Definition
  - The multi-disciplinary area of research concerned with using new and emerging forms of data, alongside computational, visualisation and statistical techniques, to study cities and their systems, tell stories and understand their issues (Alex Singleton)

### Urban Analytics
- It is imperative to be critical of these techniques & procedures: “The problem with data is that it says a lot, but it also says nothing. ‘Big data’ is terrific, but it’s usually thin. To understand why something is happening, we have to engage in both forensics and guess work." (Sendhil Mullainathan)

+++ 
### Urban Analytics
- The question is not really about what to do about and with the data. The fundamental questions are:
    - What can we know that we could not before?
    - What can we be more certain of? What are we more uncertain about?
    - How, where and why can/should we act?
