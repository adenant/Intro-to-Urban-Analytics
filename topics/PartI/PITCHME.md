## Urban Analytics, Big Data, and Smart Cities

+++
### Urban Analytics: Definition
The multi-disciplinary area of research concerned with using new and emerging forms of data, alongside computational, visualisation and statistical techniques, to study cities and their systems, tell stories and understand their issues (Alex Singleton)

+++ 
### Urban Analytics: Challenges
- The use of data and statistics in the study of cities is nothing new; but what is new is the *quantity* and *variety* of data available about cities: Unprecendented challenges in data analysis
- Importnat questions: What can, or should, one do with all of this data?
    - The data may be wasted in no one can do and generate something out of it!
    - Analysts or policymakers may got overwhelmed with the seer amount of data and information! 

+++ 
### Urban Analytics: Our attitude toward these new and emerging data?
- Bbe critical of these techniques & procedures: 
    - *“The problem with data is that it says a lot, but it also says nothing. ‘Big data’ is terrific, but it’s usually thin. To understand why something is happening, we have to engage in both forensics and guess work."* (Sendhil Mullainathan)

+++ 
### Urban Analytics
- The question is not really about what to do about and with the data. The fundamental questions are:
    - *What can we know that we could not before?*
    - *What can we be more certain of? What are we more uncertain about?*
    - *How, where and why can/should we act?*

### Definition of Big Data
Big data is often seen as ‘data exhaust,’ in other words, ‘the digitally trackable or storable actions, choices, and preferences that people generate as they go about their daily lives.’ As opposed to traditional data (e.g., surveys or census), which are collected with a specific intention and follow a structured format with valid and reliable measurements (Hilbert, 2016)

+++
### Urban data characteristics (1)

- Volume -*large Volumes of data (Terra, Petabytes) spanning large areas*
- Velocity -*produced in near-real time*
- Variety -*diverse in data sources, quality, structuredness, referenced spatially and temporally*
- Exhaustive -*usually n=all, or at least claims to be*
- Resolution -*fine grained, temporally, spatially and along other dimensions*

+++
### Urban data characteristics (2)
- Relational -*usually merged with other datasets, likely through geographic identifiers*
- Flexible -*accommodate new data streams, sensors etc.*
- Scalable -*expanded rapidly*

…

+++
### Urban Open Data
- Open licensing of data by cities enables use of municipal data without financial cost
- Emergence of central repositories that consolidate data 
    - Facilitate discovery and download of assets
    - Not all cities are able to offer such resources 
- The arguments for making data open have both an *ethical* and a *pragmatic* dimension
