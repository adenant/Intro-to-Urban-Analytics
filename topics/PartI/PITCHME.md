### Urban Analytics
- It is imperative to be critical of these techniques & procedures
  - “The problem with data is that it says a lot, but it also says nothing. ‘Big data’ is terrific, but it’s usually thin. To understand why something is happening, we have to engage in both forensics and guess work." --Sendhil Mullainathan
