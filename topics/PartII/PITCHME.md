## Part I: Introduction to R & Basic Data Visualisation

+++
### Preliminaries
- To get started with this course, you will need R and I strongly recommend Rstudio for the GUI
- You can get the latest version of R from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) and Rstudio from [https://rstudio.com/](https://rstudio.com/)
+++
### Why R?
- Great for reproducibility
- Great for statistics
- Great for data analysis and visualization
- Interdisciplinary & Extensible
- Open source & Cross Platform
- Most GIS operations can be done in R

+++
### Why not Python? Or Julia? Or C++?
Mostly because I donâ€™t know them well/or at all. They are probably great, but R works for me, for the most part.
